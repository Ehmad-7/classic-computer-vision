# Classic Computer Vision – Image Basics

This repository covers the fundamentals of **Computer Vision** using classical techniques (before deep learning).

The goal is to understand how images are represented and processed as numerical data.

---

## What This Project Covers

- Loading images using OpenCV
- Understanding image shapes and channels
- RGB vs Grayscale images
- Image resizing for machine learning models
- Basic image preprocessing

---

## Key Concepts Learned

- Images are matrices of numbers, not just pictures
- Color images have 3 channels (RGB)
- Grayscale images reduce complexity
- ML and CV models require fixed-size inputs
- Preprocessing is a critical step before CNNs
